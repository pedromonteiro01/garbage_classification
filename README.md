# Garbage Classification

First FAA project that consists of identifying and classifying images in different types of garbage. <br>Initially the dataset had 6 different classes, but we chose to work with only 3:
 - glass
 - paper
 - plastic.

It was necessary to do some data pre-processing as the dataset was unbalanced, which could lead to outliers and overfitting. <br>
For this, Each class was equally represented, that is, with the same number of images for training and testing.

Dataset available on Kaggle: <br>

Different machine learning models implemented:
 - Logistic Regression
 - SVM
 - Decision Tree
 - Random Forest
 - Neural Networks
